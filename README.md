2> Check given number is prime or not..

ex: 19//true
49//false

step 1 : take input integer from user.

step 2 : use for loop

step 3 : prime no starts with 2 ,3,5,7,11,13.... 
so based on that start loop from i= 2;

step 4 : inside for loop give one condition by using if .. 
think about logic

step 5 : if condition is true then print whether it is prime or not
